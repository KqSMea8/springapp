<h1>Why Onboarding ?</h1>
<h6>
Onboarding is the process of integrating new employees into an organization. Itâ€™s important to note the difference between onboarding and orientation. Orientation is an event, typically lasting one day, that usually begins the onboarding process. But onboarding continues for months to even years after an employee is hired.
